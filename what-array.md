Which array method to use...?

To mutuate original array;

(to add) .push .unshift (to remove) .pop .shift .splice (others) .reverse .sort .fill

A new array;

(compute from original) .map (filter using condition) .filter (protion of original) .slice (adding original to other) .concat (flattening the orginal) .flat .flatMap

An array index;

(based on value) .indexOf (base don test condition) .findIndex

An array element;

(based on test condition) .find

Know if array includes;

(based on value) .includes (based on test condition) .some .every

A new string;

(based on seperator string) .join

To transform to value;

(based on accumulator) .reduce - boil down array to single value of any type

To just loop array;

(based on callback) .forEach - does not create a new array, just loops over it
